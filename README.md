## Download ✅
Download latest release of this UNOFFICIAL fork [here](https://alonsoaliaga.com/QualityArmory/releases).

## Fork details ✅
This is a fork from [ZombieStriker's QualityArmory](https://github.com/ZombieStriker/QualityArmory) with some bug fixes in 1.17:
+ Fixed prefix not displayed with color.
+ Fixed issue with action bar.
+ Fixed issue with infinite ammo.
+ Fixed spam in console when firing weapons (related to infinite ammo).
+ Added HEX color support for items and messages. (Will never work with action bar or titles, minecraft limitations)
  * Format for HEX color is `#aabbcc` with # only. It's NOT `&#aabbcc`.

⚠️ Remember that modifying any weapon lore in config will make all weapons already created stop working. (that's how the original system work, can't change that)

## Warning ✅
I'm not the official developer of [QualityArmory](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/47561/) so I might not be able to fix future issues.
Original developer is currently facing some issues IRL so we (as users) need to understand and realize we (developer) are human also, the same way you might not be able to connect to a game for months (because of personal reasons), we (developers) might not be able to update our plugins due to personal issues too.
Please understand the original author's situation, thanks in advance.

For issues go to [QualityArmory's issue tracker](https://github.com/ZombieStriker/QualityArmory/issues) so the original author can read it once he's back.

:warning: I only fixed some issues, I don't even know how the plugin works. I was reading the plugin reviews yesterday and I realized the author needed some help, so here it is a fork with some bugs fixed (most important ones I think). I have no plans to keep updating the plugin once the original author is back, I won't add new features either.
